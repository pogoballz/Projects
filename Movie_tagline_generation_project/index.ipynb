    "Ever found yourself staring at a certain movie tagline and wondering what on earth the directors were thinking about when they came up with it? Yes, we too. On the other hand, we've also often been on the other end of the spectrum, struggling to come up with creative titles for our projects or succinct one-liners to encapsulate our business pitches. Enter our movie tagline predictor, a model we have built which we hope will provide some enlightenment to the many lost souls described above. We believe that this model can be transferrable to other salient applications, such as the web-link summarization we often see accompanying our everyday Google searches. "
